### ELM
- Phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains recognize short peptides with a core Asn-X-X-Tyr motif preceded by a short peptide segment that docks by beta augmentation. The classical PTB domains bind the motif when it is phosphorylated on the Tyr residue. However other PTBs recognise essentially the same motif when unmodified. (ELM)

### UniProt
- Interacts (via NPXY motif) with DAB2 (via PID domain); the interaction is impaired by tyrosine phosphorylation of the NPXY motif
Interacts (via NPXY motif) with LDLRAP1 (via PID domain) 
Binds LDL, the major cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein of plasma, and transports it into cells by endocytosis. In order to be internalized, the receptor-ligand complexes must first cluster into clathrin-coated pits.


### [Atomic structure of the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia phosphotyrosine-binding domain in complex with the LDL-receptor tail](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22509010/)
- The LDLR tail assumes a unique "Hook"-like structure with a double β-turn conformation, which is accommodated in distinctive ARH structural determinants (i.e., an extended backbone hydrogen-bonding platform, three hydrophobic helical grooves, and a hydrophobic pocket for Y(0)). This unique complementarity differs significantly in related PTB proteins and may account for the unique physiological role of these partners in the hepatic uptake of cholesterol LDL. 
- The unusual hydrophobic pocket for Y(0) explains the distinctive ability of ARH to internalize proteins containing either FxNPxY(0) or FxNPxF(0) sequences. Biophysical measurements reveal how mutations associated with hypercholesterolemia destabilize ARH and its complex with LDLR and illuminate LDL internalization defects seen in patients.
